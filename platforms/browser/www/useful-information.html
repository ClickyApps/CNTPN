		    <p>Neonatal care is an extremely specialised service, and not all Neonatal units have the facilities and staff to provide the full range of care for the smallest and sickest babies. If your midwife or obstetrician considers that your baby may need neonatal care, it may be recommended that you are transferred to a hospital which has the necessary facilities for your baby before he/she is born. However if transfer before the birth is not possible, and your baby is born too soon, too small or too sick then, each of our Network hospitals are able to care for your baby until the neonatal transport team arrive. They are a team of staff who are specially trained to transfer babies safely between hospitals, see CenTre Neonatal Transport section. They will then transfer your baby to the nearest Neonatal unit which is designated to provide the level of care that your baby requires.</p>
		    <p>The Neonatal units within the EMNN all work very closely together to ensure that women and their babies receive the care that they need which is as close to home and in the most appropriate Neonatal unit as possible. Your baby will be reviewed by the medical and nursing team on a daily basis to determine if he/she needs to move to another Neonatal unit to receive his/her care. For further information please refer to our ‘transfer information leaflet’.</p>

	    	<div class="question one">
	    		<h2>Types of Unit<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
	    			<h4>Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU)</h4>
					<p>These provide the highest level of care for the smallest and sickest babies in the EMNN. The babies requiring NICU care may be preterm from 23 weeks gestation, have had problems during the birth, have been identified as having problems which require complex intensive care during antenatal scanning, or need intensive care for other reasons.</p>
					<p>The Neonatal Intensive Care units in the EMNN are Nottingham City Hospital, Queen’s Medical Centre (Nottingham), and the Leicester Royal Infirmary.</p>

	    			<h4>Surgical Care</h4>
					<p>Babies who require surgical care will be cared for at Queen’s Medical Centre (Nottingham) or Leicester Royal Infirmary. If there are no specialist cots babies may need to be transferred to a Neonatal unit which is further afield, outside of the East Midlands with an available cot.</p>
					<p>If your baby requires cardiac surgery, the Glenfield Hospital (Leicester) provides most of the care for EMNN babies. If there are no available cots, babies may need to be transferred further afield, outside of the East Midlands to a cardiac hospital with an available cot.</p>


	    			<h4>Local Neonatal Units (LNU)</h4>
					<p>These provide a high level of care to the majority of babies who require neonatal care. Breathing support can be provided (including ventilation) for short periods of time, and other treatments such as intravenous fluids or nasogastric tube feeding for babies who are too ill or small to feed by mouth.</p>
					<p>The Local Neonatal Units in the EMNN are Derby Royal Hospital, Kettering General Hospital, King’s Mill Hospital (Mansfield), Lincoln County Hospital and Northampton General Hospital.</p>


	    			<h4>Special Care Units (SCU)</h4>
					<p>These provide care for those babies who are learning to feed before they go home, or need intravenous antibiotics. These units specialise in preparing you and your baby for discharge home.</p>
					<p>The Special Care Units in EMNN are Pilgrim Hospital (Boston) and Queen’s Hospital (Burton).</p>

	    		<h2>Admission to a Neonatal Unit<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>Having a premature or sick baby is often a very frightening and overwhelming experience. You may experience a wide variety of feelings and emotions, all of which are completely normal at such a stressful time. You are likely to be very anxious about your baby’s health and treatment, and this is especially difficult if you are separated from your baby. The neonatal and maternity staff understand the difficulties that families face and they will be able to provide a range of advice, support and information to help you, your family and your baby. If you feel you are really struggling to cope, please let the nurse or midwife caring for you know so that we can make sure we provide some help.</p>

					<p>If your baby is expected to need neonatal care, then it may be possible to meet some of the neonatal staff, see the Neonatal unit, and receive information before your baby is born. Often you will meet with a neonatal doctor or nurse practitioner before the birth who will talk to you about the care your baby is expected to need. If you are not offered this, please ask the midwife looking after to you to arrange it.</p>

					<p>When your baby is born, there may be extra nurses and doctors present who are able to provide the care that your baby needs. They will concentrate on your baby, but whenever it is possible they will talk to you about what they are doing. You will be able to see your baby before he/she if transferred to the Neonatal unit. We will ensure that you are able to go to the Neonatal unit to see your baby as soon as you are well enough and the neonatal team have settled your baby and provided the immediate care that he/she needs.</p>

					<p>When you see your baby for the first time on the Neonatal unit, you may be very scared and shocked. Your baby may be surrounded by medical equipment which can be bright and noisy. Your baby may be in an incubator with lots of leads and lines attached to him/her. This equipment is designed to help your baby keep warm, to breathe and to receive any fluids that he/she needs. The nurse looking after your baby will explain what all the equipment is and what it is for.</p>

 	    	<div class="question three">
	    		<h2>Separation<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
		    		<p>There are occasions when you are not able to see your baby as soon as you would like due to your health needs or if you have remained in your local hospital. In this instance we will try to connect you to the Neonatal unit using <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.centralandtrentneonatalnetwork.nhs.uk/images/Leaflets/CNNTPN%20icoNNect%20Parent%20Information%20Leaflet.pdf', '_system'); return false;">icoNNect/Facetime &raquo;</a> so that you can see your baby, and speak to the nurses and doctors who are looking after him/her. If this facility is not offered, please ask the nurse or midwife who is looking after you.</p>

	    		<h2>Access to the Unit<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
		    		<p>You and your partner, or nominated support person, will be encouraged to be with your baby as much as possible and you will have open access to the Neonatal unit 24 hours a day.  You will be encouraged to become actively involved in your baby’s care. The ways you can become involved are covered in the sections below.</p>
	    		</div>
	    	</div><!-- question four -->
 	    	<div class="question five">
	    		<h2>Family and Friends<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>The neonatal staff recognise that your family and friends are likely to be worried about your baby. It can be very difficult to explain to lots of different people what is happening. It is suggested that you relay information to one person who can keep everyone else informed. Please remember that due to confidentiality, we can only give information to the baby’s parents.</p>

					<p>We appreciate that the support of your family and friends is important. Visiting times for friends and family vary within the EMNN Neonatal units and these will be determined around the needs of the babies, especially their need for sleep and rest and to reduce the risk of infection. Please see the individual information for each unit. If you have any concerns or questions about the visiting policy, please speak to the nurse in charge of the Neonatal unit.</p>

					<p>If any of your family or friends have any coughs, colds or other illnesses, please ask them to stay away until they are better to reduce the risk of your baby become infected.</p>

	    	<div class="question one">
	    		<h2>Ward Rounds<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
		    		<p>The EMNN Neonatal units actively encourage parents to be present for the ward rounds. This is to ensure that you are fully involved with your baby’s care and are aware what treatment is planned. If you wish to become involved with presenting your baby on the ward round, please speak to the nurse who is caring for him/her. You should NOT be asked to leave the room while the ward round is taking place, this is so that you can be with your baby as much as possible. There may be very few occasions when you are asked to leave the room if there are babies who are very unwell needing urgent medical care. If this occurs then the nurses will let you know as soon as you can return.</p>
	    		</div>
	    	</div><!-- question one -->
 	    	<div class="question two">
	    		<h2>Information about your Baby’s Care<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>The nurses and doctors will liaise with you regularly to ensure that you are fully aware of any treatment and progress. Your attendance at the ward rounds will ensure that you are totally involved and you will very quickly develop a very good understanding of all the care that your baby is receiving. If you are not able to attend the ward rounds, the nurses and doctors will update you when you are on the unit. You can also telephone at any time of the day or night if you would like an update or if you are worried. It is important that you understand your baby’s treatment and that you are able to make decisions, so please ask as many questions as you like, particularly if we use words that you do not understand. You may find it helpful to write down any questions that you have so that you do not forget to ask them.</p>

					<p>You will receive lots of written information, particularly when your baby is first admitted to the Neonatal unit. Please find some time to read through this as it may help you to understand more about your baby’s care.</p>

					<p>There is some very good information which is produced by charities such as <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.bliss.org.uk/', '_system'); return false;">Bliss &raquo;</a>, <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.tommys.org/', '_system'); return false;">Tommy’s &raquo;</a> and <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.bestbeginnings.org.uk/', '_system'); return false;">Best Beginnings &raquo;</a>. All of this information is free of charge and should be available on the neonatal unit.  If using the internet, please try to stick to the information provided by these sites as using a search engine may result in you finding information which is not accurate and may cause you unnecessary worry.</p>

					<p>Bliss has produced a series of <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.bliss.org.uk/introduction-to-a-neonatal-unit-video-series', '_system'); return false;">videos &raquo;</a> to help parents and the Best Beginnings Small Wonders DVD is available on their <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.bestbeginnings.org.uk/watch-small-wonders-online', '_system'); return false;">website &raquo;</a> and on each of our Neonatal units. The DVD follows families’ journeys from before birth until after their babies have gone home from hospital and contains lots of useful information about different aspects of your baby’s care.</p>

					<p>If English is not your first language and you are finding it difficult to understand what is happening to your baby, please let the staff know so that they can organise an interpreter to visit the Neonatal unit or speak on the telephone using a system called Language Line.</p>

	    	</div><!-- question two -->
 	    	<div class="question three">
	    		<h2>Emotional Help for Parents<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>The nurses caring for your baby are a good source of support, as are your partner, family and friends. You may also wish to talk to your Community Midwife, Health Visitor or GP. Sometimes you may find it easier to talk to someone who doesn’t know you. Some Neonatal units have a counsellor or a psychologist who can meet with you. Each hospital has a chaplaincy team who can provide you with a listening ear. They are very accustomed to speaking with worried relatives and do so regardless of any religious beliefs.</p>

					<p>Some units have a <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.bliss.org.uk/be-a-bliss-champion', '_system'); return false;">Bliss Champion &raquo;</a>, or parent peer supporters who have had babies on a Neonatal unit in the past, or FAB workers. These have all had special training and they can all provide you with some emotional support, guidance and useful information. Many of our Neonatal units also have coffee mornings where you can meet other parents and have a chat and a cup of tea.</p>

					<p>Bliss, the national charity for babies born too soon, too small and too sick, has lots of ways to help families. The Bliss website <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.bliss.org.uk/', '_system'); return false;">www.bliss.org.uk &raquo;</a> has lots of helpful information and an online message board where you can talk to other parents. There is also a free help and advice line open from 10 am to 12pm and 7pm to 9pm pm Monday to Wednesday and 10am – 12pm Thursday to Friday. The helpline number is 0808 801 0322. The helpline uses the Language Line translation service so if English is not your first language, you can call leaving your name, phone number and the language you speak, and they will call you back. You can also email Bliss on <a href="mailto:hello@bliss.org.uk">hello@bliss.org.uk &raquo;</a> at any time or find Bliss on <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.facebook.com/Blisscharity', '_system'); return false;">Facebook &raquo;</a> or <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://twitter.com/blisscharity', '_system'); return false;">twitter &raquo;</a>.</p>

					<p>Taking your baby home is a happy time, but it can also be stressful when you no longer have the support of the neonatal nurses. Our Neonatal units all have support groups for families whose babies have been on the Neonatal units, and the details and venues will be given to you before your baby is discharged. These support groups can be invaluable to parents and can help you form strong friendships for you and your baby for the future.</p>

	    		<h2>Getting Involved in your Baby’s Care<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>You are the most important person to your baby, and being present on the Neonatal unit as much as you are able, will help him/her to recover as quickly as possible.</p>

					<p>The nurses and doctors will encourage and support you to be involved as much or as little as you feel able.</p>

					<p>The ways in which you can be involved are described in the sections below;</p>

	    	</div><!-- question four -->
 	    	<div class="question five">
	    		<h2>Parent Passport<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>A Network parent passport is provided to all babies who are admitted to the EMNN Neonatal units.  These are provided to ensure that there is an accurate record of what the neonatal staff have taught you and to ensure that you can continue to provide the same care if your baby is moved to another unit. The staff will encourage you to complete the various sections about your learning and the information that they have provided you with. Not all sections of the passport will be relevant to your baby, so there may be sections which you do not complete.</p>

					<p>The passport will belong to you when your baby is discharged and they can become a keepsake to remind you of your baby’s care on the Neonatal unit.</p>

					<p>If you have not received a parent passport, please ask the nurse who is caring for your baby if you can have one.</p>

	    		<h2>Audit<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
		    		<p>All Neonatal units across the country are audited on the standards of neonatal care that they should achieve. To read these standards and what it means to you as a parent please refer to <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/system/files/protected/page/NNAP%20Parent%20and%20Carer%20Report%202017_0.pdf', '_system'); return false;">‘your baby’s care, measuring standards and improving neonatal care’ &raquo;</a>.  This leaflet may give you an idea of some questions to ask of the nurses and doctors caring for your baby.</p>
	    		</div>
	    	</div><!-- question one -->
 	    	<div class="question two">
	    		<h2>Expressing your Breast Milk<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>If your baby has been born too early, too small, very unwell, or with other medical problems, then you may be asked to consider expressing your breast milk. This is because breast milk would be the very best milk for your baby while your baby is on the neonatal unit and would provide the best possible start. Nurses and doctors view your breast milk as a medicine as it has lots of benefits for your baby’s health, including the immune system, bowel and brain. Even if your baby is not yet able to feed, breast milk can be used for cleaning his/her mouth or can provide pain relief.</p>

					<p>You will start expressing your colostrum by hand within 6 hours of your baby’s birth. Then after a few days you will move onto a hospital breast pump. These are usually available on the Neonatal unit and the postnatal ward. Many of our Neonatal units also have pumps you can borrow and take home.</p>

					<p>Midwives, nurses and feeding advisors can teach you how to hand express and how to use the breast pumps. You will need to express 8-10 times in 24 hours to establish your milk supply, including during the night. This is sometimes difficult when you are tired, but it is really important as one of the milk producing hormones, prolactin, is at its highest level at night. Do not worry if you only get a few drops at first as this is perfectly normal. Make sure you collect them though as every drop is precious to your baby. Your milk supply will increase with time. Help and advice is available at all times if you experience any problems.</p>

					<p>The small wonders DVD has a very good film ‘How to Hand Express’ which shows you <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://sw4.bestbeginnings.org.uk/video/46022506', '_system'); return false;">how to hand express &raquo;</a>. Further information is also available from <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.bliss.org.uk/expressing', '_system'); return false;">Bliss &raquo;</a>, <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/breastfeeding-premature-baby.aspx', '_system'); return false;">NHS Choices &raquo;</a>, <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/labour-birth/after-birth/feeding-your-baby/breastfeeding', '_system'); return false;">Tommy’s &raquo;</a> and <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/neonatal_leaflet_online.pdf', '_system'); return false;">Unicef &raquo;</a>.</p>

	    	</div><!-- question two -->
 	    	<div class="question three">
	    		<h2>Touch<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>Parental touch can be very calming and soothing to a baby when they are on a Neonatal unit. Babies enjoy a still, firm touch which is often referred to as comfort or containment holding. It involves circling one hand around your baby’s head and cupping the other hand around your baby’s feet, or placing a hand on his/her tummy. The nurses will teach you how to do this. Babies also like to grasp hold of your finger.</p>

					<p>Before touching your baby, please remove all jewellery and wash and gel your hands. It is a good idea to prepare your baby for touch by speaking softly to him/her so that you do not make him/her jump. Try to breathe deeply and relax so that you baby does not pick up any stress or anxiety that you may be feeling.</p>

					<p>By watching your baby closely, you will begin to understand his/her behaviour and what he/she is trying to say to you. The nurses can help you to understand these cues and the Bliss booklet <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.bliss.org.uk/information-for-parents', '_system'); return false;">‘look at me, I’m talking to you’ &raquo;</a> will also help you to develop this understanding.</p>

					<p>When your baby is able to be held, the staff will encourage you to have a cuddle. One of the best ways is to hold your baby skin to skin. This has many more benefits than holding your baby wrapped in blankets.</p>
	    		</div>
	    	</div><!-- question three -->
 	    	<div class="question four">
	    		<h2>Skin to Skin Contact<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>This is often also called kangaroo care and it involves you holding your baby on your chest. Your baby will be naked except for a nappy and a hat. It helps if you have loose top, or one that opens at the front as it makes it easier to position your baby. Blankets will be placed around you, or you may use a specially designed sling. You may wish to hold a small mirror so that you can easily see your baby’s face. It is also a good time to get some photographs of you both together.</p>

					<p>Mums, Dads and siblings can be kangaroo carers and it has many benefits for the whole family. It helps with breast milk supply, feeding, bonding, and attachment, and it can reduce any anxiety that you may be experiencing.  It can also help to promote sleep and weight gain, regulates your baby’s temperature, heart rate, and breathing, and also provides a positive sensory experience as your baby can feel and smell your skin.</p>

					<p>There are no time limits to how long you can hold your baby this way. At least an hour is beneficial, but your baby can stay skin to skin until he/she shows signs that they are no longer enjoying the experience.</p>

					<p>For more information watch the <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://sw5.bestbeginnings.org.uk/video/46081746', '_system'); return false;">‘having skin to skin contact’ &raquo;</a> film on the Small Wonders DVD and read the Bliss booklet <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.bliss.org.uk/information-for-parents', '_system'); return false;">‘skin to skin with your premature baby’ &raquo;</a>.</p>

	    	</div><!-- question four -->
 	    	<div class="question five">
	    		<h2>Mouth Care, Nappy Changing and Bathing<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>When you feel ready, you may want to become more involved in your baby’s personal care. You may be happy to start straight away, however some parents are anxious that they may hurt their baby or disturb medical equipment. The nurses will help and guide you, and your confidence will soon grow. If you are nervous, it may help if you support and comfort your baby while the nurse changes the nappy, and then gradually increase how much you do until you are confident and happy to change the nappy yourself.</p>

					<p>It is important to handle your baby gently and carefully, paying attention to his/her behavioural cues (body language), and slowing down when he/she needs a rest.</p>

					<p>Many parents will start with mouth care. When cleaning your baby’s mouth, try to use breast milk as it is antibacterial and smells and tastes nice.</p>

					<p>When your baby can manage his/her own temperature without special equipment and is getting ready to go home, you will be taught how to bath him/her. You will be taught a slightly different technique which is called swaddled bathing. This is to reduce the stress of the bath for your baby. As this is a really special time for parents, the nurse may demonstrate with a doll so that you can give your baby his/her first bath. If you would prefer not to do this, then the nurses will be happy to bath your baby and support you until you become more confident. Make sure you have your camera handy so that you can capture such a special moment!</p>

	    	</div><!-- question five -->


	    	<div class="question one">
	    		<h2>Tube Feeding<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>Most parents on a Neonatal unit learn how to tube feed their babies and do most of the feeds themselves when they are on the unit. The Neonatal units across the EMNN have agreed a tube feeding competency package for parents and produced associated <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.centralandtrentneonatalnetwork.nhs.uk/images/Leaflets/CNNTPN%20Tube%20Feeding%20Baby%20on%20the%20NNU.pdf', '_system'); return false;">parent information &raquo;</a>. This will ensure that you are taught the same way no matter where in the EMNN your baby receives his/her neonatal care. This will also ensure that you can continue doing the tube feeds if your baby is moved to another Neonatal unit. The nurses will ensure that you are totally confident and happy to undertake the feeds before you do any feeds on your own.</p>

					<p>Some babies may go home partially tube fed while they establish their feeding via the breast or bottle. If this is the case you will be supported at home by a neonatal outreach nurse. This will often enable parents to take their babies home sooner and to establish the feeding at home in a more relaxed environment.</p>
	    		</div>
	    	</div><!-- question one -->
 	    	<div class="question two">
	    		<h2>Breast Feeding<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>Babies are normally able to coordinate breathing, sucking and swallowing from 34 weeks. When your baby shows signs that they are ready to start practice feeding, you will be encouraged to try him/her at the breast. This can occur from around 32 weeks corrected gestational age, but it can occur a bit earlier with some babies. Skin to skin is a good way of seeing if your baby is ready to start breast feeding, as the smell of breast milk may stimulate feeding behaviours such as rooting and licking.</p>

					<p>Your baby may not latch well at first and is very likely to need tube feeds until the feeding is well established, but every breast feed helps your baby to learn. You may start with one or two breast feeds a day, and this will increase as your baby begins to feed more effectively. Bottles will not be given to your baby without your permission.</p>

					<p>When your baby is just about ready to go home, you may wish to stay overnight in the hospital so that you can have your baby in the room with you and provide all of his/her care with the support of the staff. This is called ‘rooming in’ and is generally in a room on the Neonatal unit.</p>

					<p>Why is breast feeding so important?</p>
					<p>Your breast milk is tailor made by you for your baby.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>It provides antibodies that protect your baby against bacteria and viruses.</li>
						<li>It boosts your baby’s immune system.</li>
						<li>It reduces the risk of serious gut infections such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), and helps to protect against other infections.</li>
						<li>It provides nutrients, growth factors and hormones that help your baby to grow and develop.</li>
						<li>It is really easy to digest and is absorbed much better than formula milk.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Premature babies have different nutritional needs than babies who are born at full term. Their digestive system is less mature and they need more time to develop their sucking skills. Babies who have been very sick sometimes are not able to tolerate their milk very well initially so breast milk is easier to digest and absorb.</p>

					<p>The Neonatal unit staff will support you with your breastfeeding. Breast pumps may be available for you to loan and take home so that you can express until your baby is able to feed effectively.</p>

	    		<h2>Bottle Feeding<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>When you baby is ready to start bottle feeding, you will be taught how to do this safely by the nursing staff. We encourage you to be available for as many feeds as possible to enable you and your baby to learn together. We recommend that only the main caregivers such as mum and partner (or other chosen person) feed the baby to promote bonding and attachment.</p>

					<p>Babies who have been born prematurely or with certain medical problems will be fed in a special elevated side-lying position. The babies are normally swaddled lightly to improve their muscle tone. Research shows that babies fed this way have better coordination, a more stable heart rate and improved oxygen levels.</p>

					<p>Your baby should be offered a bottle when he/she is awake, alert and rooting. Research shows that babies who are fed this way (cue based) learn the skills needed to bottle feed more quickly. Your baby may tire very easily at first, or show signs that he/ she is stressed. It is important to notice these signs and give the rest of the milk by tube. This helps to prevent long term feeding problems.</p>

					<p>As your baby practices bottle feeding, his/her skills will develop. If you have any worries about your baby’s feeding skills, please talk to the nurses.</p>

					<p>When your baby is just about ready to go home, you may wish to stay overnight in the hospital so that you can have your baby in the room with you and provide all of his/her care with the support of the staff. This is called ‘rooming in’ and is generally in a room on the Neonatal unit.</p>

	    		<h2>Feeling Closer to your Baby<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>Each of the Neonatal units in the EMNN are committed to providing family centred care. This means that we encourage you to be present on the Neonatal unit as much as you are able and that we teach you to care for your baby. We understand parent’s feelings and we will support and encourage you to become involved in care giving and decision making. This will help you to develop a strong bond with your baby.</p>

					<p>Talking softly, singing and reading are all good ways of interacting with your baby. He/she will recognise your voice from hearing it from inside the womb. Your baby will also recognise your scent. You may wish to wear a small piece of fabric next to your skin and then place it next to your baby if you leave the Neonatal unit, as this scent makes babies feel safe and secure. Smell is an important part of the bonding process, so it is important not to wear strong perfumes. You should also seek advice from the staff if you smoke.</p>

					<p>You may wish to take an item of your baby’s clothing that he/she has been wearing home with you, along with a photograph, as this has been shown to help with the flow of breast milk when you are expressing.</p>

					<p>Some parents find that keeping a diary of your baby’s stay in the Neonatal unit to be very good for dealing with all your feelings and ensuring that you do not forget any parts of your baby’s journey. This is also a wonderful keepsake for when you go home.  Some Neonatal units provide baby diaries and there are also some very good apps that you can use. If you are not able to be with your baby as much as you would like, then the nurses may write about your baby’s progress in your diary if would like them to.</p>

					<p>Some Neonatal units provide keepsakes such as quilts. You may wish to start collecting items such as probes and phototherapy masks in a memory box so that you can show your baby just how small they were when he/she gets older.</p>

					<p>You may wish to take lots of photographs as your baby progresses. Many parents like to take the photos of their baby with the same object such as a cuddly toy, which will help you to see how quickly he/she has grown, even if it doesn’t seem that way at first.</p>

					<p>In most Neonatal units, you may put a cuddly toy in the incubator with your baby, and small comforters for premature babies that they can hold onto, are available to purchase. Please check that any toys do not have any parts that could be dangerous to your baby’s safety. If you are unsure, the nurses will be able to check them for you.</p>

					<p>The nursing staff will encourage you to have your baby out of his/her incubator for kangaroo care as soon as his/her condition is stable enough. See ‘skin to skin contact’ section.  This is an ideal time to bond with your baby and for you both to get to know one another. Remember to get some precious photographs of these special moments.</p>

	    		<h2>Developmental Care<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>Developmental care is an important part of your baby’s medical and nursing care. It aims to reduce the stress experienced by you and your baby during the neonatal journey. It also helps to achieve the best developmental outcomes for your baby.</p>

					<p>An important aspect of developmental care is seeing your baby as an individual and adapting care to your baby’s needs. This will be helped by the completion of an ‘all about me’ sheet which will be completed by you with the help of the nursing staff.</p>

					<p>Sleep is very important for the growth and development of your baby’s brain so the neonatal unit staff aim to promote sleep by reducing light and noise and by positioning your baby comfortably. Careful positioning allows your baby to comfort him/herself, to develop movement and to avoid postural problems. The staff will move and care for your baby gently, and will teach you the same techniques, so that your baby experiences as little stress as possible. They will also teach you to understand your baby’s cues (body language).  For further information please read the Bliss booklet <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.bliss.org.uk/information-for-parents', '_system'); return false;">‘look at me, I’m talking to you’ &raquo;</a>.</p>

					<p>You should also expect to see incubators and cots covered until your baby is close to term. This is also to promote restful sleep. You will also see baby nests, gel pillows and boundaries which help with good positioning. Again the nursing staff will teach you how to make your baby comfortable.</p>

					<p>Some Neonatal units have a rest time, or quiet time, where no routine care is given to allow the babies to rest undisturbed.</p>

					<p>To help with the development of feeding skills and to promote bonding all the Neonatal units in EMNN will encourage kangaroo care.  See ‘skin to skin contact’ section.</p>

					<p>Pain assessment and management is also an important part of your baby’s care. There are many ways to reduce and prevent any pain and these include; non-nutritive sucking, use of breast milk and sucrose (a sweet solution).</p>

					<p>All developmental care is family-centred and you will be encouraged to be involved in all aspects of your baby’s care. This includes providing comfort during any procedures if you wish to do so.</p>

					<p>Every unit in the EMNN has a nurse who is responsible for developmental care who will be very happy to answer any questions that you may have.</p>

	    		<h2>Vaccinations<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>It is very important that all babies receive their vaccinations according to the NHS guidelines, which is at 8 weeks of age. This advice is the same for premature babies, as long as the medical team feel that he/she is well enough to be vaccinated. The medical and nursing team will discuss this with you and will ask for your consent before giving your baby any vaccines.</p>

	    		<h2>Facing Hard Decisions<span>&raquo;</span></h2>
	    		<div>
					<p>Medical care for premature and sick babies has made huge advances, but some babies are so ill, that even the highest level of care will not change the outcome. If your baby is very ill, then you may have to make some difficult decisions about his /her care. This will be a very difficult, frightening time as you may be faced with the possibility of your baby dying.</p>

					<p>At this time, you may wish to have the support of family, friends and spiritual advisors. Whatever your wishes are, the staff will try to assist with your requests where possible.</p>

					<p>The staff will discuss the options for your baby’s care and treatment with you, and they will provide information and support.</p>

					<p>The nurses and the doctors will always have your baby’s best interests at heart, and they will ensure that your baby is treated with respect and dignity and that he /she is comfortable and pain free.</p>

					<p>Neonatal units have very close links to community nursing teams and <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('https://www.rainbows.co.uk/', '_system'); return false;">Rainbows &raquo;</a> the local hospice for children and young people. Hospices are experts in caring for babies with life-limiting conditions and provide excellent support to the families, and this may be an option that you wish to consider.</p>
