            <h6>Who are we</h6>
	    	<p>The CenTre Neonatal Transport Service is a team of highly skilled doctors and nurses who have lots of experience in stabilising and transferring sick and premature babies. These babies may need specialist or continuing care in another hospital or they may be returning to a hospital closer to their family home for on going care.</p>
            <p>The transport team will introduce themselves to you when they arrive. They will then work with the team from your neonatal unit to ensure that your baby is as stable as possible before they are transferred. This can often be a very busy time for the team but they will keep you informed of what is happening.</p>
	    	<h6>Will my baby be safe in the ambulance?</h6>
            <p>We will continue to provide all of the specialist care that your baby needs during the journey. Your baby will be secured into our transport incubator using a special harness, much like a car seat harness. The incubator allows us to keep your baby warm. Our specialist equipment allows us to monitor their heart rate, temperature, breathing rate and blood oxygen levels. We are able to give any fluids or medicines that you baby may need using our infusion pumps. We can also help your baby with any breathing problems they may have.</p>
            <h6>Can I travel with my baby?</h6>
            <p>There may be the opportunity, if you are well enough, for one parent to travel with us in the ambulance. The transport team will talk to you about this, but please ask them if they don’t mention it. You must be fit and well and discharged from post natal care. You should also be able to get into and out of the ambulance by yourself.</p>
            <p>If you suffer from motion sickness it may be advisable for you not to travel in the ambulance. If you do travel with your baby you will be expected to remain in your seat with your seat belt fastened unless told otherwise by a member of our team.</p>
            <p>If you are unable to travel with your baby please do no attempt to follow our ambulance. Please do ensure that you travel at a safe and steady speed. Our team should give you information about the hospital your baby is being transferred to.</p>
            <p>Our transport team work in partnership with the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trusts to ensure your baby is transferred safely in one of our dedicated neonatal ambulances.</p>
            <h6>What if I have any concerns about my baby’s transfer?</h6>
            <p>The transport team will be with your baby throughout the journey in the ambulance. We will be observing and monitoring your baby for any changes in their condition throughout the journey. We will also make regular notes on your baby’s condition during the journey which we will share with the team in the hospital your baby is being transferred to.</p>
            <p>If you have any concerns please speak to one of the transport team before they leave in the ambulance.</p>
            <p>We welcome any comments or feedback about our team. Please scan the code with your smartphone below to fill in our parents questionnaire. It is only 10 questions long and we would value your opinion on our service, in particular anything that we could have done that would have improved our service to you and your family.</p>
