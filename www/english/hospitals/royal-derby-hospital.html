Neonatal Consultants are available every day to talk to parents. Parents are also encouraged to telephone the Unit at any time of the day / night for an update. <br />We also have icoNNect a facility that allow mothers to see their baby, meet the staff providing their baby's care and discuss baby's care needs during any periods of separation through the use of iPads and Facetime. This is available for mothers who are on the labour/ postnatal ward or mothers who are unable to visit/ at home.</p>
