    			<h3>What to expect when you arrive</h3>
    			<p><strong>Who to ask for on arrival</strong><br/>Sister in Charge and the nurse who will be supporting you to care for your baby. You will be given an admission pack with information about having a baby in a neonatal unit. Nursing staff will go through this information with you.</p>
                <p><strong>Who will give initial update on baby’s condition and timing?</strong><br />Senior Doctor admitting Baby and Nurse allocated to support family in caring for Baby.</p>
                <p><strong>Ward round times and whether parents are included</strong><br />Consultant led Ward round is held from approx.1100hrs to 1300hrs and parents are encouraged to be part of this. There are Doctors hand overs at 0800hrs and 2000hrs each day. Nurse hand over at the beginning of each shift takes place at approx. 0700hrs and 1900hrs.</p>
                <p><strong>Frequency of updates on baby’s condition and by whom</strong><br />The philosophy on the Unit is to have open and honest discussions with Parents at all times throughout the course of their baby’s stay. Nursing staff are proactive in their approach to sharing information. Neonatal Consultants are available every day to talk to Parents. Parents are also encouraged to telephone the Unit at any time of the day/night for an update. There is a designated direct phone number for use by families to facilitate this and this is given to families on admission of their baby and is for use by parents/ carers only. If families would like a discussion with the Consultant, at any time please ask the nurse supporting you care for your baby.</p>
                <p><strong>Family Centred Care</strong><br />As parents you will be the main carers of your baby and we would like you to care for your baby as much as possible. The nurses supporting you care for your baby will guide you and show you how to care for your baby. The green cot-side folders are all about your baby and we would ask you to read these folders and participate in the Admission to Discharge Care Pathway. Please so not hesitate to ask about anything in this folder you do not understand. This folder can be found in the drawers of the observation chart trolley next to incubator or cot.</p>
                <p><strong>Quiet time – when &amp; what happens</strong><br />Quiet time is usually between the hours of 1330-1430. This is when lights are switched off and blinds are closed within the neonatal unit bays. Nursing and medical interventions with the babies are discouraged to allow the babies to have at least an hour where they can rest in a quiet darkened room. It also gives the opportunity for parents/carers time to be with their baby in calm surroundings. It is good opportunity for skin to skin contact and this is encouraged.</p>
