    			<h3>What to expect when you arrive</h3>
    			<p><strong>Who to ask for on arrival</strong><br/>Ask to see the nurse who will support you to care for your baby or the Nurse in Charge.</p>
                <p><strong>Who will give initial update on baby’s condition and timing?</strong><br />Senior Doctor admitting Baby and Nurse allocated to support family in caring for Baby. You will be given an admission pack with information about having a baby in a neonatal unit. Nursing staff will go through this information with you.</p>
                <p><strong>Ward round times and whether parents are included</strong><br />Consultant ward round takes place between 11.00 and 1300hrs. <br />Parents are actively encouraged to Participate in the consultant ward rounds when they take place. Doctor’s handover rounds at 8am and 8pm. <br />Nurse hand over at the beginning of each shift takes place at approx. 0700hrs and 1900hrs. <br />Please ask if you would like to speak to consultant or others in wider team on a one to one basis someone as required and this will be arranged for you.</p>
                <p><strong>Family Centred Care</strong><br />As parents you will be the main carers of your baby and we would like you to care for your baby as much as possible. The nurses supporting you care for your baby will guide you and show you how to care for your baby. The green cot-side folders are all about your baby and we would ask you to read these folders and participate in the Discharge Care Pathway, please so not hesitate to ask about any of this folder you do not understand. This folder can be found in the drawers of the observation chart trolley next to incubator or cot.</p>
                <p><strong>Frequency of updates on baby’s condition and by whom</strong><br />The philosophy on the Unit is to have open and honest discussions with Parents at all times throughout the course of their baby’s stay. Nursing staff are proactive in their approach to sharing information. Neonatal Consultants are available every day to talk to Parents. Parents are also encouraged to telephone the Unit at any time of the day/night for an update. There is a designated direct phone number for use by families to facilitate this and this is given to families on admission of their baby and is for use by parents/ carers only. If families would like a discussion with the Consultant, at any time please ask the nurse supporting you caring for your baby.</p>
                <p><strong>Quiet time – when &amp; what happens</strong><br />Quiet time is usually between the hours of 1330-1430. This is when lights are switched off and blinds are closed within the neonatal unit bays. Nursing and medical interventions with the babies are discouraged to allow the babies to have at least an hour where they can rest in a quiet darkened room. It also gives the opportunity for parents/carers time to be with their baby in calm surroundings. It is good opportunity for skin to skin contact and this is encouraged.</p>
